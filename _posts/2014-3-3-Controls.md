## Electrical

This year we have switched to using only Spark MAXs and NEOs. NEOs have been beneficial because they are smaller and lighter but still stronger than the red-line motors we have used in previous years. They also offer better control with their built in encoders. These built in encoders are more accurate than separate ones, which are also very difficult to install.

We have also switched to using Wago inline splicing connectors instead of quick connects. We made this change because they are far easier and faster to make and are reusable. 

In order to make more room for the robotâ€™s arm, and to make the robot heavier in the back to prevent it from tipping forward when the arm moves, we moved all the electrical components to the back of the robot, with the battery, the heaviest part, the furthest towards the back.
